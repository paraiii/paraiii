# 👋 Hi there, I'm BZ

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented **Software Engineer** with strong experience in:
- 🔧 Front end web development (React, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, Rest)
- ☁️ Cloud infrastructure (AWS, CI/CD)
- 🧪 Testing (Jest)
- 🎨 UI/UX polish & accessibility

I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can lead technical uplift, mentor peers, and build delightful user experiences.
